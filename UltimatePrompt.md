+ Technology Stack
    + Frontend: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
    + Backend: Next.js API Routes(if needed), Nextjs SSR (Must be Used where needed), MongoDB for File Storage & Records (Mongoose)   
    + Authentication: JWT using Jose (JSON Web Tokens)
    + File Storage: MongoDB Collections (Files & Files Content are Separate Collections, Safe file handling to prevent path traversal, Max 2 depth of folders & more configurable)
    + Rich Text Editor: Monaco Editor or similar

+ üé® UI/UX:

    Clean modern layout:

        Sidebar: folder/file tree with breadcrumbs

        Main pane: code editor or file preview

        Toolbar with actions: Save, Rename, Delete, New File/Folder

    Light/Dark mode toggle

    Responsive design (works on mobile)

    Download single file or whole folder as .zip

    Notifications for success/errors

+ ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Notes:

    Never store passwords or access level in frontend JS or localStorage

    Use backend authentication only

    Use session or JWT tokens (with expiration)

    Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal

    Rate-limit login attempts

    Only allow safe file types (e.g., .txt, .md, .py, .c, .lua)

+üîê Access Control:

    Editor role (full access to files)

    View-only role (can view files and folder structure but cannot modify)

    Access level enforced on backend (API Routes or SSR Based) (never in frontend)

    Each API must validate user session and permissions

+üìÅ File & Folder System:

    Users can:

        Create, rename, delete, copy, and move text/code files

        Create, rename, delete, copy, and move folders

        Support for nested folders

    Syntax-highlighting editor (CodeMirror or Monaco)

        Allow user to choose language (e.g., text, Python, Lua, C)

    Preview file with line numbers (read-only mode)

    Search feature:

        By file/folder name

        Inside file content
